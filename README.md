# Project-Spyn
ASU FSE100 Project

Creating a Semi-Autonomous Vehicle capable of "picking up" (in the most literal sense) passengers and navigating a maze; avoiding obstacles/walls and detecting color zones on the floor for stops/changes to remote control.

## Branch Info
A variation with a second ultrasonic sensor and the gyroscope mounted on a module that's rotated by a medium motor. 
### Intended Effects
Scan upon turn sequence to check all open routes before turning, putting a 180deg rotation as the lowest priority
### Optional Effects
Have the sensor rotate 360deg continuously, taking a scan at 90 and 270deg to keep the vehicle centered and moving straight.
